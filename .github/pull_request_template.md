<!--
Talk about what a user would see (a big, a new feature) and what
user goals weren't being met. If the commit fixes a bug, describe how
the bug was discovered and steps to reproduce it, unless this is
already covered by the related issues. If this is a bug fix, what was
the mistake in the application logic? Be precise. Act like a detective
and report your findings.
-->

<!--
Why did you make the change this way? What other ways did you consider
but reject? Explain how amazing your work is.
-->

<!--
What risks are associated with making the changes in the commit? Will
anything else break? Are the changes backwards-compatible? Is there
any "tech debt"?
-->

<!--
Explain the source code changes. Changes that are fully explained in
code comments or the above paragraphs don't need to be repeated here.
Use bullet points, e.g.

* `src/stk/molecular/atoms/atom.py:Atom.get_id()`: The method
  parameters were updated because <some reason>. The places where
  the method was called were also updated.

<!--
Give evidence that the commit works. Did you visually inspect any
changes to molecular structures yourself?
