    Represents a COF topology graph.

    Notes
    -----
    COF topologies are added by creating a subclass, which defines
    the :attr:`_vertex_prototypes` and :attr:`_edge_prototypes` class
    attributes.

    Examples
    --------
    *Subclass Implementation*

    The source code of the subclasses, listed in :mod:`~.cof.cof`,
    can serve as good examples.

    *Basic Construction*

    :class:`.Cof` instances can be made by providing the building
    block molecules and lattice size only (using :class:`.Honeycomb`
    as an example)

    .. code-block:: python

        import stk

        bb1 = stk.BuildingBlock('BrCCBr', [stk.BromoFactory()])
        bb2 = stk.BuildingBlock('BrCC(CBr)CBr', [stk.BromoFactory()])
        cof = stk.ConstructedMolecule(
            topology_graph=stk.cof.Honeycomb((bb1, bb2), (3, 3, 1)),
        )

    *Accessing the Periodic Unit Cell*

    The same :class:`.Cof` instance can be built as a periodic
    structure, which has a unit cell (assuming as P1 space group) that
    can be accessed at any time from the :class:`.TopologyGraph`
    instance.

    .. code-block:: python

        topology_graph = stk.cof.PeriodicHoneycomb(
            building_blocks=(bb1, bb2),
            lattice_size=(3, 3, 1),
        )
        cof = stk.ConstructedMolecule(topology_graph)
        periodic_info = topology.get_periodic_info()
        cell_matrix = periodic_info.get_cell_matrix()
        # Can access all unit-cell parameters.
        a = periodic_info.get_a()
        b = periodic_info.get_b()
        c = periodic_info.get_c()
        alpha = periodic_info.get_alpha()
        beta = periodic_info.get_beta()
        gamma = periodic_info.get_gamma()

    *Structural Isomer Construction*

    Different structural isomers of COFs can be made by using the
    `vertex_alignments` optional parameter

    .. code-block:: python

        cof2 = stk.ConstructedMolecule(
            topology_graph=stk.cof.Honeycomb(
                building_blocks=(bb1, bb2),
                lattice_size=(3, 3, 1),
                vertex_alignments={0: 2, 1: 1, 2: 1},
            ),
        )

    The parameter maps the id of a vertex to a number
    between 0 (inclusive) and the number of edges the vertex is
    connected to (exclusive). So a vertex connected to three edges
    can be mapped to ``0``, ``1`` or ``2``.

    By changing which edge each vertex is aligned with, a different
    structural isomer of the COF can be formed.

    *Multi-Building Block COF Construction*

    You can also build COFs with multiple building blocks, but,
    if you have multiple building blocks with the same number of
    functional groups, you have to assign each building block to the
    vertex you want to place it on

    .. code-block:: python

        bb1 = stk.BuildingBlock('BrCCBr', [stk.BromoFactory()])
        bb2 = stk.BuildingBlock('BrCNCBr', [stk.BromoFactory()])
        bb3 = stk.BuildingBlock('BrCC(CBr)CBr', [stk.BromoFactory()])
        bb4 = stk.BuildingBlock('BrCC(NCBr)CBr', [stk.BromoFactory()])

        cof = stk.ConstructedMolecule(
            topology_graph=stk.cof.Honeycomb(
                # building_blocks is now a dict, which maps building
                # blocks to the id of the vertices it should be placed
                # on. You can use ranges to specify the ids.
                building_blocks={
                    bb1: (2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19),
                    bb2: 3,
                    bb3: (0, 10, 11, 15, 16),
                    bb4: (1, 5, 6),
                },
                lattice_size=(2, 2, 1),
            ),
        )

    You can combine this with the `vertex_alignments` parameter

    .. code-block:: python

        cof2 = stk.ConstructedMolecule(
            topology_graph=stk.cof.Honeycomb(
                building_blocks={

        Initialize a :class:`.Cof` instance.

        Parameters
        ----------
        building_blocks : :class:`tuple` or :class:`dict`
            Can be a :class:`tuple` of :class:`.BuildingBlock`
            instances, which should be placed on the topology graph.

            Can also be a :class:`dict` which maps the
            :class:`.BuildingBlock` instances to the ids of the
            vertices it should be placed on. A :class:`dict` is
            required when there are multiple building blocks with the
            same number of functional groups, because in this case
            the desired placement is ambiguous.

        lattice_size : :class:`tuple` of :class:`int`
            The size of the lattice in the x, y and z directions.

        periodic : :class:`bool`, optional
            Toggle the construction of a periodic molecule. If
            ``True``, periodic bonds will be made across the edges of
            the lattice.

        vertex_alignments : :class:`dict`, optional
            A mapping from the id of a :class:`.Vertex`
            to an :class:`.Edge` connected to it.
            The :class:`.Edge` is used to align the first
            :class:`.FunctionalGroup` of a :class:`.BuildingBlock`
            placed on that vertex. Only vertices which need to have
            their default edge changed need to be present in the
            :class:`dict`. If ``None`` then the default edge is used
            for each vertex. Changing which :class:`.Edge` is used will
            mean that the topology graph represents different
            structural isomers. The edge is referred to by a number
            between ``0`` (inclusive) and the number of edges the
            vertex is connected to (exclusive).

        reaction_factory : :class:`.ReactionFactory`, optional
            The reaction factory to use for creating bonds between
            building blocks.

        num_processes : :class:`int`, optional
            The number of parallel processes to create during
            :meth:`construct`.

        Raises
        ------
        :class:`AssertionError`
            If the any building block does not have a
            valid number of functional groups.

        :class:`ValueError`
            If the there are multiple building blocks with the
            same number of functional_groups in `building_blocks`,
            and they are not explicitly assigned to vertices. The
            desired placement of building blocks is ambiguous in
            this case.

        :class:`~.cof.UnoccupiedVertexError`
            If a vertex of the COF topology graph does not have a
            building block placed on it.

        :class:`~.cof.OverlyOccupiedVertexError`
            If a vertex of the COF topology graph has more than one
            building block placed on it.

        Map building blocks to the vertices of the graph.

        Parameters
        ----------
        building_blocks : :class:`iterable` of :class:`.BuildingBlock`
            The building blocks which need to be mapped to `vertices`.

        vertices : :class:`iterable` of :class:`.Vertex`
            The vertices which need to have a building block map to

        edges : :class:`iterable`of :class:`.Edge`
            The edges of the graph.

        -------
        :class:`dict`
            Maps each building block in `building_blocks` to a

        Raises
        ------
        :class:`AssertionError`
            If the any building block does not have a
            valid number of functional groups.

        :class:`ValueError`
