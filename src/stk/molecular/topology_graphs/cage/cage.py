class Cage(TopologyGraph):
    """
    Represents a cage topology graph.

    Notes
    -----
    Cage topologies are added by creating a subclass, which defines the
    :attr:`_vertex_prototypes` and :attr:`_edge_prototypes` class
    attributes.

    Examples
    --------
    *Subclass Implementation*

    The source code of the subclasses, listed in :mod:`~.cage.cage`,
    can serve as good examples.

    *Basic Construction*

    :class:`.Cage` instances can be made by providing the building
    block molecules only (using :class:`.FourPlusSix` as an example)

    .. code-block:: python

        import stk

        bb1 = stk.BuildingBlock('NCCN', [stk.PrimaryAminoFactory()])
        bb2 = stk.BuildingBlock(
            smiles='O=CC(C=O)C=O',
            functional_groups=[stk.AldehydeFactory()],
        )
        cage1 = stk.ConstructedMolecule(
            topology_graph=stk.cage.FourPlusSix((bb1, bb2)),
        )

    *Structural Isomer Construction*

    Different structural isomers of cages can be made by using the
    `vertex_alignments` optional parameter

    .. code-block:: python

        cage2 = stk.ConstructedMolecule(
            topology_graph=stk.cage.FourPlusSix(
                building_blocks=(bb1, bb2),
                vertex_alignments={0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 2},
            ),
        )

    The parameter maps the id of a vertex to a number
    between 0 (inclusive) and the number of edges the vertex is
    connected to (exclusive). So a vertex connected to three edges
    can be mapped to ``0``, ``1`` or ``2``.

    By changing which edge each vertex is aligned with, a different
    structural isomer of the cage can be formed.

    *Multi-Building Block Cage Construction*

    You can also build cages with multiple building blocks, but,
    if you have multiple building blocks with the same number
    of functional groups, you have to assign each building block to the
    vertex you want to place it on

    .. code-block:: python

        bb1 = stk.BuildingBlock(
            smiles='O=CC(C=O)C=O',
            functional_groups=[stk.AldehydeFactory()],
        )
        bb2 = stk.BuildingBlock(
            smiles='O=CC(Cl)(C=O)C=O',
            functional_groups=[stk.AldehydeFactory()],
        )
        bb3 = stk.BuildingBlock('NCCN', [stk.PrimaryAminoFactory()])
        bb4 = stk.BuildingBlock(
            smiles='NCC(Cl)N',
            functional_groups=[stk.PrimaryAminoFactory()],
        )
        bb5 = stk.BuildingBlock('NCCCCN', [stk.PrimaryAminoFactory()])

        cage = stk.ConstructedMolecule(
            topology_graph=stk.cage.FourPlusSix(
                # building_blocks is now a dict, which maps building
                # blocks to the id of the vertices it should be placed
                # on. You can use ranges to specify the ids.
                building_blocks={
                    bb1: range(2),
                    bb2: (2, 3),
                    bb3: 4,
                    bb4: 5,
                    bb5: range(6, 10),
                },
            ),
        )

    You can combine this with the `vertex_alignments` parameter

    .. code-block:: python

        cage = stk.ConstructedMolecule(
            topology_graph=stk.cage.FourPlusSix(
                building_blocks={

        Initialize a :class:`.Cage`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        building_blocks : :class:`iterable` or :class:`dict`
            Can be a :class:`iterable` of :class:`.BuildingBlock`
            instances, which should be placed on the topology graph.

            Can also be a :class:`dict` which maps the
            :class:`.BuildingBlock` instances to the ids of the
            vertices it should be placed on. A :class:`dict` is
            required when there are multiple building blocks with the
            same number of functional groups, because in this case
            the desired placement is ambiguous.

        vertex_alignments : :class:`dict`, optional
            A mapping from the id of a :class:`.Vertex`
            to an :class:`.Edge` connected to it.
            The :class:`.Edge` is used to align the first
            :class:`.FunctionalGroup` of a :class:`.BuildingBlock`
            placed on that vertex. Only vertices which need to have
            their default edge changed need to be present in the
            :class:`dict`. If ``None`` then the default edge is used
            for each vertex. Changing which :class:`.Edge` is used will
            mean that the topology graph represents different
            structural isomers. The edge is referred to by a number
            between ``0`` (inclusive) and the number of edges the
            vertex is connected to (exclusive).

        reaction_factory : :class:`.ReactionFactory`, optional
            The reaction factory to use for creating bonds between
            building blocks.

        num_processes : :class:`int`, optional
            The number of parallel processes to create during
            :meth:`construct`.

        Raises
        ------
        :class:`ValueError`
            If the there are multiple building blocks with the
            same number of functional_groups in `building_blocks`,
            and they are not explicitly assigned to vertices. The
            desired placement of building blocks is ambiguous in
            this case.
