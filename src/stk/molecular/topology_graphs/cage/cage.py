    Notes
    -----
    Cage topologies are added by creating a subclass, which defines the
    :attr:`_vertex_prototypes` and :attr:`_edge_prototypes` class
    attributes.

    Examples
    --------
    *Subclass Implementation*

    The source code of the subclasses, listed in :mod:`~.cage.cage`,
    can serve as good examples.

    *Basic Construction*

    :class:`.Cage` instances can be made by providing the building
    block molecules only (using :class:`.FourPlusSix` as an example)

    .. code-block:: python

        import stk

        bb1 = stk.BuildingBlock('NCCN', [stk.PrimaryAminoFactory()])
        bb2 = stk.BuildingBlock(
            smiles='O=CC(C=O)C=O',
            functional_groups=[stk.AldehydeFactory()],
        )
        cage1 = stk.ConstructedMolecule(
            topology_graph=stk.cage.FourPlusSix((bb1, bb2)),
        )

    *Structural Isomer Construction*

    Different structural isomers of cages can be made by using the
    `vertex_alignments` optional parameter

    .. code-block:: python

        cage2 = stk.ConstructedMolecule(
            topology_graph=stk.cage.FourPlusSix(
                building_blocks=(bb1, bb2),
                vertex_alignments={0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 2},
            ),
        )

    The parameter maps the id of a vertex to a number
    between 0 (inclusive) and the number of edges the vertex is
    connected to (exclusive). So a vertex connected to three edges
    can be mapped to ``0``, ``1`` or ``2``.

    By changing which edge each vertex is aligned with, a different
    structural isomer of the cage can be formed.

    *Multi-Building Block Cage Construction*

    You can also build cages with multiple building blocks, but,
    if you have multiple building blocks with the same number
    of functional groups, you have to assign each building block to the
    vertex you want to place it on

    .. code-block:: python

        bb1 = stk.BuildingBlock(
            smiles='O=CC(C=O)C=O',
            functional_groups=[stk.AldehydeFactory()],
        )
        bb2 = stk.BuildingBlock(
            smiles='O=CC(Cl)(C=O)C=O',
            functional_groups=[stk.AldehydeFactory()],
        )
        bb3 = stk.BuildingBlock('NCCN', [stk.PrimaryAminoFactory()])
        bb4 = stk.BuildingBlock(
            smiles='NCC(Cl)N',
            functional_groups=[stk.PrimaryAminoFactory()],
        )
        bb5 = stk.BuildingBlock('NCCCCN', [stk.PrimaryAminoFactory()])

        cage = stk.ConstructedMolecule(
            topology_graph=stk.cage.FourPlusSix(
                # building_blocks is now a dict, which maps building
                # blocks to the id of the vertices it should be placed
                # on. You can use ranges to specify the ids.
                building_blocks={
                    bb1: range(2),
                    bb2: (2, 3),
                    bb3: 4,
                    bb4: 5,
                    bb5: range(6, 10),
                },
            ),
        )

    You can combine this with the `vertex_alignments` parameter

    .. code-block:: python

        cage = stk.ConstructedMolecule(
            topology_graph=stk.cage.FourPlusSix(
                building_blocks={
                    bb1: range(2),
                    bb2: (2, 3),
                    bb3: 4,
                    bb4: 5,
                    bb5: range(6, 10),
                },
            ),
            vertex_alignments={0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 2},
        )

    *Metal-Organic Cage Construction*

    A series of common metal-organic cage topologies are provided and
    can be constructed in the same way as other :class:`.Cage`
    instances using metal atoms and :class:`DativeReactionFactory`
    instances to produce metal-ligand bonds. Each metal topology has
    specific vertices reserved for the metal atoms or complexes,
    which are listed in their documentation.

    .. code-block:: python

        import stk

        # Produce a Pd+2 atom with 4 functional groups.
        palladium_atom = stk.BuildingBlock(
            smiles='[Pd+2]',
            functional_groups=(
                stk.SingleAtom(stk.Pd(0, charge=2))
                for i in range(4)
            ),
            position_matrix=[[0., 0., 0.]],
        )

        # Build a building block with two functional groups using
        # the SmartsFunctionalGroupFactory.
        bb1 = stk.BuildingBlock(
            smiles=(
                'C1=NC=CC(C2=CC=CC(C3=C'
                'C=NC=C3)=C2)=C1'
            ),
            functional_groups=[
                stk.SmartsFunctionalGroupFactory(
                    smarts='[#6]~[#7X2]~[#6]',
                    bonders=(1, ),
                    deleters=(),
                ),
            ],
        )

        cage1 = stk.ConstructedMolecule(
            stk.cage.M2L4Lantern(
                building_blocks=(palladium_atom, bb1),
                # Ensure that bonds between the GenericFunctionalGroups
                # of the ligand and the SingleAtom functional groups
                # of the metal are dative.
                reaction_factory=stk.DativeReactionFactory(
                    stk.GenericReactionFactory(
                        bond_orders={
                            frozenset({
                                stk.GenericFunctionalGroup,
                                stk.SingleAtom
                            }): 9
                        }
                    )
                )
            )
        )

    *Controlling Metal-Complex Stereochemistry*

    When building metal-organic cages from octahedral metals, i.e.
    Fe(II), the stereochemistry of the metal centre can be important.
    Maintaining that stereochemistry around specific metal centres
    during :class:`.Cage` construction is difficult, so an
    alternative route to these types of structures can be taken.
    Firstly, you would construct a :class:`.MetalComplex` instance
    with the appropriate stereochemistry and dummy reactive groups
    (bromine in the following example)

    .. code-block:: python

        # Produce a Fe+2 atom with 6 functional groups.
        iron_atom = stk.BuildingBlock(
            smiles='[Fe+2]',
            functional_groups=(
                stk.SingleAtom(stk.Fe(0, charge=2))
                for i in range(6)
            ),
            position_matrix=[[0, 0, 0]],
        )

        # Define coordinating ligand with dummy bromine groups and
        # metal coordianting functional groups.
        bb2 = stk.BuildingBlock(
            smiles='C1=NC(C=NBr)=CC=C1',
            functional_groups=[
                stk.SmartsFunctionalGroupFactory(
                    smarts='[#6]~[#7X2]~[#35]',
                    bonders=(1, ),
                    deleters=(),
                ),
                stk.SmartsFunctionalGroupFactory(
                    smarts='[#6]~[#7X2]~[#6]',
                    bonders=(1, ),
                    deleters=(),
                ),
            ]
        )

        # Build iron complex with delta stereochemistry.
        iron_oct_delta = stk.ConstructedMolecule(
            stk.metal_complex.OctahedralDelta(
                metals=iron_atom,
                ligands=bb2,
            )
        )

    Then the metal complexes
    can be placed on the appropriate :class:`.Cage` topology
    to produce a structure with the desired stereochemistry at all
    metal centres.

    .. code-block:: python

        # Assign Bromo functional groups to the metal complex.
        iron_oct_delta = stk.BuildingBlock.init_from_molecule(
            molecule=iron_oct_delta,
            functional_groups=[stk.BromoFactory()],
        )

        # Define spacer building block.
        bb3 = stk.BuildingBlock(
            smiles=(
                'C1=CC(C2=CC=C(Br)C=C2)=C'
                'C=C1Br'
            ),
            functional_groups=[stk.BromoFactory()],
        )

        # Build an M4L6 Tetrahedron with a spacer.
        cage2 = stk.ConstructedMolecule(
            stk.cage.M4L6TetrahedronSpacer(
                building_blocks=(
                    iron_oct_delta,
                    bb3,
                ),
            )
        )

    *Aligning Metal Complex Building Blocks*

    When building metal-organic cages from metal complex
    building blocks, it is common that
    the metal complex :class:`.BuildingBlock` will have
    multiple functional groups, but that those functional groups
    are overlapping. This means that some of its atoms appear in
    multiple functional groups. A difficulty arises when the
    atom shared between the functional groups is a *placer* atom.

    *Placer* atoms are used to align building blocks, so that
    they have an appropriate orientation in the final topology.
    If there is only one *placer* atom, no alignment can be made,
    as no vector running between *placer* atoms can be defined,
    and used for the alignment of the :class:`.BuildingBlock`.

    By default, :mod:`stk` may create overlapping functional
    groups, which may lead to a lack of an appropriate number
    of *placer* atoms, leading to a :class:`.BuildingBlock`
    being unalinged. However, the user can manually set the
    *placer* atoms of functional groups, so that not all of the
    *placer* atoms appear in multiple functional groups, which
    leads to proper alignment.

    First we build a metal complex

    .. code-block:: python

        import stk

        metal_atom = stk.BuildingBlock(
            smiles='[Pd+2]',
            functional_groups=(
                stk.SingleAtom(stk.Pd(0, charge=2))
                for i in range(4)
            ),
            position_matrix=[[0., 0., 0.]],
        )

        ligand = stk.BuildingBlock(
            smiles='NCCN',
            functional_groups=[
                stk.SmartsFunctionalGroupFactory(
                    smarts='[#7]~[#6]',
                    bonders=(0, ),
                    deleters=(),
                ),
            ]
        )

        metal_complex = stk.ConstructedMolecule(
            stk.metal_complex.CisProtectedSquarePlanar(
                metals=metal_atom,
                ligands=ligand,
            )
        )

    Next, we convert the metal complex into a :class:`.BuildingBlock`,
    taking care to define functional groups which do not have
    overlapping *placer* atoms

    .. code-block:: python

        metal_complex = stk.BuildingBlock.init_from_molecule(
            molecule=metal_complex,
            functional_groups=[
                stk.SmartsFunctionalGroupFactory(
                    smarts='[Pd]~[#7]',
                    bonders=(0, ),
                    deleters=(),
                    # The nitrogen atom will be different
                    # for each functional group.
                    placers=(0, 1),
                ),
            ]
        )

    We load in the organic linker of the cage as normal

    .. code-block:: python

        linker = stk.BuildingBlock(
            smiles='C1=NC=CC(C2=CC=NC=C2)=C1',
            functional_groups=[
                stk.SmartsFunctionalGroupFactory(
                    smarts='[#6]~[#7X2]~[#6]',
                    bonders=(1, ),
                    deleters=(),
                ),
            ]
        )

    And finally, we build the cage with a
    :class:`DativeReactionFactory` instance to produce dative bonds.

    .. code-block:: python

        cage = stk.ConstructedMolecule(
            stk.cage.M4L4Square(
                corners=metal_complex,
                linkers=linker,
                reaction_factory=stk.DativeReactionFactory(
                    stk.GenericReactionFactory(

                            }): 9
                        }
                    )

            If the there are multiple building blocks with the
            same number of functional_groups in `building_blocks`,
            and they are not explicitly assigned to vertices. The
            desired placement of building blocks is ambiguous in
            this case.

        :class:`~.cage.UnoccupiedVertexError`
            If a vertex of the cage topology graph does not have a
            building block placed on it.

        :class:`~.cage.OverlyOccupiedVertexError`
            If a vertex of the cage topology graph has more than one
            building block placed on it.
