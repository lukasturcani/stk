    Creates functional groups from substructures, which match the

    Examples
    --------
    *Creating Functional Groups with the Factory*

    You want to create a building block which has :class:`.Fluoro`
    functional groups. You want the non-fluorine atom in those
    functional groups to be the *bonder* atom, and the fluorine atom
    to be the *deleter* atom.

            smiles='FCCCF',
