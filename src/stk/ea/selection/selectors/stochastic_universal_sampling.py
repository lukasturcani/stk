Stochastic Universal Sampling

class StochasticUniversalSampling(Selector):
    """
    Yields batches of molecules through stochastic universal sampling.

    Stochastic universal sampling lays out batches along a line, with
    each batch taking up length proportional to its fitness. It
    then creates a set of evenly spaced pointers to different points
    on the line, each of which is occupied by a batch. Batches which
    are pointed to are yielded.

    This approach means weaker members of the population
    are given a greater chance to be chosen than in
    :class:`.Roulette` selection [#]_.

    to be selected for mutation or the next generation.

        Initialize a :class:`.StochasticUniversalSampling` instance.

        Parameters
        ----------
        num_batches : :class:`int`, optional
            The number of batches to yield. If ``None`` then yielding
            will continue forever or until the generator is exhausted,
            whichever comes first.

        batch_size : :class:`int`, optional
            The number of molecules yielded at once.

        duplicate_molecules : :class:`bool`, optional
            If ``True`` the same molecule can be yielded in more than
            one batch.

        duplicate_batches : :class:`bool`, optional
            If ``True`` the same batch can be yielded more than once.

        key_maker : :class:`.MoleculeKeyMaker`, optional
            Used to get the keys of molecules. If two molecules have
            the same key, they are considered duplicates.

        fitness_modifier : :class:`callable`, optional
            Takes the `population` on which :meth:`.select` is called
            and returns a :class:`dict`, which maps records in the
            `population` to the fitness values the :class:`.Selector`
            should use. If ``None``, the regular fitness values of the
            records are used.

        random_seed : :class:`int`, optional
            The random seed to use.
