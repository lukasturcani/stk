class Selector:
    """
    An abstract base class for selectors.

    Selectors select batches of molecules from a population.
    Each batch is selected based on its fitness. The fitness of a
    batch is the sum of all fitness values of the molecules in the
    batch. Batches may be of size 1.

    Notes
    -----
    You might notice that some of the public methods of this abstract
    base class are implemented. This is purely for convenience when
    implementing subclasses. The implemented public methods are simply
    default implementations, which can be safely ignored or overridden,
    when implementing subclasses. Any private methods are
    implementation details of these default implementations.

    *The Default Implementation*

    This section is only of use to people who want to add a new
    :class:`.Selector` subclass, and want to make use of the default
    implementation to make this job easier.

    When using the default implementation you do not need to
    implement :meth:`.select`, which is already provided, but instead
    :meth:`._select_from_batches` needs to be implemented. What the
    default implementation provides, is code, which does the batching
    of a `population` for you, which means you only have to worry
    about implementing the selection algorithm, which works on batches
    directly.

    The default implementation also automatically updates a
    :class:`.YieldedBatches` object for you, so that you can keep track
    of which batches have already been yielded, in case you want to
    prevent duplicate selection of batches or molecule records. Though
    whether you want to make use of this will depend on the nature of
    your selection algorithm.

    The source code of the classes listed in :mod:`.selector` can serve
