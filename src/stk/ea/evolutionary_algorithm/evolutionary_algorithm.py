class EvolutionaryAlgorithm:
    """
    An abstract base class for evolutionary algorithms.

    Notes
    -----
    You might notice that the public methods of this abstract base
    class are implemented. This is purely for convenience, so that
    there is a default evolutionary algorithm implementation that
    users can use. However, feel free to override the default
    implementation when implementing subclasses.

    If you do want to use the default implementation, here is a
    summary of the roles of the different components:

    Examples
    --------
    *Subclass Implementation*

    The source code of this class can work as a good example. There
    is only one method that a subclass of
    :class:`.EvolutionaryAlgorithm` needs to implement,
    :meth:`.get_generations`, which yields :class:`.Generation`
    instances. These correspond to the generations of your
    evolutionary algorithm implementation.

    *Usage*

    There are a couple of tutorials on how to use the
    :class:`.EvolutionaryAlgorithm`, which can be found in the sidebar.

        Parameters
        ----------
        initial_population : :class:`tuple` of :class:`.MoleculeRecord`
            The initial population the EA should use.

        fitness_calculator : :class:`.FitnessCalculator`
            Calculates fitness values.

        mutator : :class:`.MoleculeMutator`
            Carries out mutation operations.

        crosser : :class:`.MoleculeCrosser`
            Carries out crossover operations.

        generation_selector : :class:`.Selector`
            Selects the next generation.

        mutation_selector : :class:`.Selector`
            Selects molecules for mutation.

        crossover_selector : :class:`.Selector`
            Selects molecules for crossover.

        fitness_normalizer : :class:`.FitnessNormalizer`
            Normalizes fitness values.

        key_maker : :class:`.MoleculeKeyMaker`, optional
            Used to detect duplicate molecules in the EA. If two
            molecules in a generation return the same key, one of them
            is removed.

        num_processes : :class:`int`, optional
            The number of parallel processes the EA should create.
