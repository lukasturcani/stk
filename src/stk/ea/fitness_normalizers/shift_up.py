    Shifts negative fitness values to be positive.

    Assume you have a vector-valued fitness value, where each number
    represents a different property of the molecule, for example,
    ``[1, -10, 1]``

    One way to convert the vector-valued fitness value into a
    scalar fitness value is by summing the elements, and the result in
    this case would be ``-8``. Clearly this doesn't work, because the
    resulting fitness value is not a positive number. To fix this,
    the ``-10`` should be shifted to a positive value.

    :class:`.ShiftUp` finds the minimum value of each element in the
    vector-valued fitness value across the entire population, and for
    elements where this minimum value is less than ``0``, shifts up
    the element value for every molecule in the population, so that the
    minimum value in the entire population is ``1``.

    For example, take a population with the vector-valued fitness
    values

    .. code-block:: python

            [1, -5, 5]
            [3, -10, 2]
            [2, 20, 1]

    After normalization the fitness values will be.

    .. code-block:: python

            [1, 6, 5]
            [3, 1, 2]
            [2, 31, 1]

    :class:`.ShiftUp` also works when the fitness value is a
    single value.

    Examples
    --------
    *Ensuring Positive Fitness Values*

    Here you final fitness value is calculated by taking a
    :class:`.Sum` of the different components of the fitness value.
    To ensure that the final sum is positive, each component must
    also be positive.

    *Selectively Normalizing Fitness Values*

    Sometimes, you only want to normalize some members of a population,
    for example if some do not have an assigned fitness value,
    because the fitness calculation failed for whatever reason.
    You can use the `filter` parameter to exclude records from the
    normalization

        filter : :class:`callable`, optional

            normalized. By default, all molecules will have fitness
            values normalized.

            the second argument will be passed every
