Fitness normalizers are classes which are responsible for normalizing
the fitness values in an :class:`.EAPopulation`. They analyze the
fitness values across the entire population and calculate new ones.

To see how :class:`FitnessNormalizer` can be used, look at the
documention of the classes which inherit it, for example
:class:`.Power`, :class:`.Sum` :class:`.DivideByMean`. In addition,
multiple :class:`.FitnessNormalizer` can be chained using
:meth:`.Sequence`.


.. _`adding fitness normalizers`:

Making New Fitness Normalizers

A new class inheriting :class:`FitnessNormalizer` must be made.

implemented.

    Divides fitness values by the population mean.

    While this function can be used if the fitness value of each
    :class:`.Molecule` in the :class:`.EAPopulation` is a single
    number, it is most useful when the fitness values is a
    :class:`list` of numbers. In this case, it is necessary to somehow
    combine the numbers so that a single fitness value is produced.
    For example, take a fitness value which is the vector holding the
    properties ``[energy, diameter, num_atoms]``. For a given molecule
    these numbers may be something like ``[200,000, 12, 140]``. If we
    were to sum these numbers, the energy term would dominate the final
    fitness value. In order to combine these numbers we can divide them
    by the population averages. For example, if the average energy
    of molecules in the population is ``300,000`` the average diameter
    is ``10`` and the average number of atoms is ``70`` then the
    fitness vector would be scaled to ``[0.5, 1.2, 2]``. These
    numbers are now of a similar magnitude and can be summed to give a
    reasonable value. After division , each value represents how
    much better than the population average each property value is.
    In essence we have removed the units from each parameter.

    One way to convert the vector-valued fitness value into a

    this case would be ``-8``. Clearly this doesn't work, because the
    resulting fitness value is not a positive number. To fix this,
    the ``-10`` should be shifted to a positive value.

    :class:`.ShiftUp` finds the minimum value of each element in the
    vector-valued fitness value across the entire population, and for
    element where this minimum value is less than ``0``, shifts up
    the element value for every molecule in the population, so that the
    minimum value in the entire population is ``1``.

    For example, take a population with the vector-valued fitness
    values

            Takes a single parameter, the :class:`.Population` which
            needs to be normalized, before it is filtered, and
            returns an :class:`object` which is used as the new
            fitness value for all molecules which pass the
            `filter`.

        filter : :class:`callable`, optional
            Takes a two parameters, first is a :class:`.EAPopulation`
            and the second is a :class:`.Molecule`, and
            returns ``True`` or ``False``. Only molecules which
            return ``True`` will have fitness values replaced. By
            default, all molecules will have fitness values replaced.
            The :class:`.EAPopulation` on which :meth:`normalize` is
            called is passed as the first argument while the second
            argument will be passed every :class:`.Molecule` in it.
