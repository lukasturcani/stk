class Population:
    """
    A container for  :class:`.Molecule` objects.

    :class:`Population` instances can be nested.

    In addtion to holding :class:`.Molecule` objects, the
    :class:`Population` class can be used to create large numbers of
    these instances through the class methods beginning with "init".

    :class:`.Molecule` instances held by a :class:`Population` can have
    their structures optimized in parallel through the
    :meth:`optimize` method.

    The only operations directly implemented by this class are those
    relevant to its role as a container. It supports all expected and
    necessary container operations such as iteration, indexing,
    membership checks (via the ``is in`` operator) as would be
    expected. Details of the various implementations and a full list of
    supported operations can be found by examining the included
    methods.

    Attributes
    ----------
    populations : :class:`list` of :class:`Population` instances
        A list of other instances of the :class:`Population` class.
        This allows the implementation of subpopulations or
        evolutionary islands. This attribute is also used for grouping
        molecules within a given population for organizational
        purposes.

    members : :class:`list` of :class:`.Molecule` instances
        Held here are the members of the population which are not held
        within any subpopulations. This means that not all members of a
        population are stored in this attribute. To access all members
        of a population the generator :meth:`all_members` should be
        used.

        Removes duplicates from the population and preserves structure.

        The question of which molcule is preserved when duplicates are

        the topmost population is preserved" is not the case here.

        different subpopulations are being removed. In this case it is
        assumed that it is more important to have a single instance
        than to worry about which subpopulation it is in.

        If the duplicates are being removed from within subpopulations,
