        Calculates the energy using MOPAC.

        valid license.

        Parameters
        ----------
        settings : :class:`dict`, optional
            A dictionary which maps the names of the optimization
            parameters to their values. Valid values are:

                'hamiltonian' : :class:`str` (default = ``'PM7'``
                    A series of different methods can be selected:
                    PM7, PM6, AM1, CIS (CISD, CISDT), MNDO, RM1, etc..

                    PM7 is the latest version of the reparametrization
                    of NDDO theory, where all the atomic and diatomic
                    parameters were re-optimized / updated from PM6
                    [#]_.

                'eps' : :class:`float` (default = ``80.1``)
                    Sets the dielectric constant for the solvent.
                    Presence of this keyword will cause the COSMO
                    (Conductor-like Screening Model) method to be used
                    to approximate the effect of a solvent model
                    surrounding the molecule. Solvents with a low
                    dielectric constant are not likely to work well
                    with this model. ``0`` means that the dielectric
                    constant is not included in the calculation.
                    ``80.1`` can be used to model a water environment
                    at room temperature.

                'charge' : :class:`float` (default = ``0``)
                    The charge of the system.

                'timeout' : :class:`float` (default = ``172800``)
                    The amount in seconds the calculation is allowed to
                    run before being terminated. The default value is
                    ``2`` days or ``172,800`` seconds.

        mopac_path : :class:`str`
            The full path to the MOPAC installation.

        Returns
        -------
        :class:`float`
            The calculated energy.
