==============
Basic Examples
==============


Creating Building Blocks
========================

There are a number of ways to create :class:`.BuildingBlock` molecules,
but the two most common ways are direct creation through SMILES
strings and loading them from molecule structure files.


.. code-block:: python

    import stk

    bb1 = stk.BuildingBlock('NCCCN')
    bb2 = stk.BuildingBlock.init_from_file('path/to/file.mol')


Look at the documentation of :class:`.BuildingBlock` to see other
available initialization methods. They are easy to find, as they all
begin with :mod:`init`.

Specifying Multiple Functional Groups
=====================================

When you create a :class:`.BuildingBlock`, you also need to specify
which atoms are modified during construction of a
:class:`.ConstructedMolecule`. This is achieved by providing the
:class:`.BuildingBlock` with
:mod:`~.functional_groups.functional_group` instances. To save you
the pain of creating function groups one by one, you can use a
:mod:`~.functional_group_factory`. If you have a building block
with bromo groups, and you want the bromo groups to be modified
during construction, you would use a :class:`.BromoFactory`

.. code-block:: python

    import stk

    bb = stk.BuildingBlock('BrCCCBr', [stk.BromoFactory()])

The ``bb``, in the example above, would have two :class:`.Bromo`
functional groups. Similarly, if you have a building block with
aldehyde groups

.. code-block:: python

    bb2 = stk.BuildingBlock('O=CCCC=O', [stk.AldehydeFactory()])

In this example, ``bb2`` will have two :class:`.Aldehyde` functional
groups. Finally, if you have both aldehyde and bromo groups on a
molecule, and you want both to be modified during construction,
you would use both of the factories

.. code-block:: python

    bb3 = stk.BuildingBlock(
        smiles='O=CCCBr',
        functional_groups=[stk.AldehydeFactory(), stk.BromoFactory()],
    )

In the example above, ``bb3`` has one :class:`.Bromo` and one
:class:`.Aldehyde` functional group.

Constructing Molecules
======================

To construct molecules, you need to create a new
:class:`.ConstructedMolecule`. The required input consists of
a :class:`.TopologyGraph`, which, in turn,  requires
:class:`.BuildingBlock` instances.

.. code-block:: python

    import stk

    # React the amine functional groups during construction.
    bb1 = stk.BuildingBlock('NCCN', [stk.PrimaryAminoFactory()])
    # React the aldehyde functional groups during construction.
    bb2 = stk.BuildingBlock('O=CCCC=O', [stk.AldehydeFactory()])
    # Build a polymer.
    polymer = stk.ConstructedMolecule(
        topology_graph=stk.polymer.Linear(
            building_blocks=(bb1, bb2),
            repeating_unit='AB',
            num_repeating_units=12,
        ),
    )

    # Build a longer polymer.
    longer = stk.ConstructedMolecule(
        topology_graph=stk.polymer.Linear(
            building_blocks=(bb1, bb2),
            repeating_unit='AB',
            num_repeating_units=23,
        ),
    )

Each topology graph requires different input parameters.
For example, organic cage topology graphs only require the
:class:`.BuildingBlock` instances.

.. code-block:: python

    cage = stk.ConstructedMolecule(stk.cage.FourPlusSix((bb1, bb2)))


Read the documentation for each kind of :class:`.TopologyGraph`, for
more examples on how to initialize it, and to see what optional
parameters you have available.

Using RDKit to Optimize Molecular Structures
============================================

Molecules used by :mod:`stk` can be structure optimized both before and
after construction. One easy way to do is, is with the
:mod:`rdkit` library. You can optimize any :mod:`stk`
:class:`.Molecule`, such as a :class:`.BuildingBlock`

.. code-block:: python

    import stk
    import rdkit.Chem.AllChem as rdkit

    bb = stk.BuildingBlock('BrCCBr', [stk.BromoFactory()])

    # Optimize with the MMFF force field.

    rdkit_bb = bb.to_rdkit_mol()
    rdkit.SanitizeMol(rdkit_bb)
    rdkit.MMFFOptimizeMolecule(rdkit_bb)

    # stk molecules are immutable. with_position_matrix returns a
    # a clone, holding the new position matrix.
    bb = bb.with_position_matrix(
        position_matrix=rdkit_bb.GetConformer().GetPositions(),
    )

or a :class:`.ConstructedMolecule`

.. code-block:: python

    polymer = stk.ConstructedMolecule(
        topology_graph=stk.polymer.Linear((bb, ), 'A', 15),
    )

    # Optimize with the MMFF force field.

    rdkit_polymer = polymer.to_rdkit_mol()
    rdkit.SanitizeMol(rdkit_polymer)
    rdkit.MMFFOptimizeMolecule(rdkit_polymer)

    # stk molecules are immutable. with_position_matrix returns a
    # a clone, holding the new position matrix.
    polymer = polymer.with_position_matrix(
        position_matrix=rdkit_polymer.GetConformer().GetPositions(),
    )

Writing Molecular Files
=======================

The simplest way to save molecules is to write them to a file.
This works with any :class:`.Molecule`, including both the
:class:`.BuildingBlock`

.. code-block:: python

    import stk

    bb = stk.BuildingBlock(
        smiles='ICCBr',
        functional_groups=[stk.BromoFactory(), stk.IodoFactory()],
    )
    bb.write('bb.mol')


and the :class:`.ConstructedMolecule`

.. code-block:: python

    polymer = stk.ConstructedMolecule(
        topology_graph=stk.polymer.Linear((bb, ), 'A', 10),
    )
    polymer.write('polymer.mol')

You can see what file formats are supported by reading the
documentation for :meth:`~.Molecule.write`.

.. _placing-and-retrieving-molecules-from-a-database:

Placing and Retrieving Molecules From a Database
================================================

Requirements
------------

:mod:`stk` allows you to place molecules into a
:class:`.MoleculeDatabase`. Out-of-the-box, :mod:`stk` comes
with support for a :class:`.MoleculeMongoDb`. In order to use it
locally, you have to install MongoDB on your computer. You will
then also have to install :mod:`pymongo` with::

    $ pip install pymongo

Documentation for installing, and making sure your local MongoDB is
working properly, can be found here__. Trust me, this is easy to do
and worth it.

__ https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/

You can also use a remote MongoDB, in which case you do not have to
install it locally, but you will still need to install
:mod:`pymongo`.

Molecules and Building Blocks
-----------------------------

To place molecules into the database, first create the database

.. code-block:: python

    import stk
    import pymongo


    # Connect to a MongoDB. This example connects to a local
    # MongoDB, but you can connect to a remote DB too with
    # MongoClient() - read the documentation for pymongo to see how
    # to do that.
    client = pymongo.MongoClient()
    db = stk.MoleculeMongoDb(client)

You then create and place a molecule into the database,
for example, a :class:`.BuildingBlock`

.. code-block:: python

    bb = stk.BuildingBlock('BrCCBr', [stk.BromoFactory()])
    # Note that as soon as put() is called, the molecule is placed
    # into permanent storage.
    db.put(bb)

Note that :mod:`stk` databases do not have a staging area. The
moment you call :meth:`~.MoleculeDatabase.put`, the molecule is
committed to the database.

To retrieve a molecule from the database, by default, you would
provide the InChIKey. To first thing you might want to do is write a
function which turns the SMILES of a molecule into the InChIKey

.. code-block:: python

    import rdkit.Chem.AllChem as rdkit

    def get_inchi_key(smiles):
        return rdkit.MolToInchiKey(rdkit.MolFromSmiles(smiles))

Now we can load the molecule from the database, by providing the
SMILES of the molecule

.. code-block:: python

    loaded = db.get({
        'InChIKey': get_inchi_key('BrCCBr'),
    })

However, this step can be customized. For example, the documentation of
:class:`.MoleculeMongoDb`, shows how you can use SMILES to retrieve
your molecules, without needing to write a function like
:func:`get_inchi_key`.

The ``loaded`` molecule is only a :class:`.Molecule` instance,
and not a :class:`.BuildingBlock` instance, which means that it lacks
functional groups. You can restore your functional groups however

.. code-block:: python

    loaded_bb = stk.BuildingBlock.init_from_molecule(
        molecule=loaded,
        functional_groups=[stk.BromoFactory()],
    )

Constructed Molecules
---------------------

You can use the same database for placing
:class:`.ConstructedMolecule` instances

.. code-block:: python

    polymer = stk.ConstructedMolecule(
        topology_graph=stk.polymer.Linear((bb, ), 'A', 2),
    )
    db.put(polymer)

and restore them in the same way

.. code-block:: python

    loaded = db.get({
        'InChIKey': get_inchi_key('BrCCCCBr'),
    })

However, once again, ``loaded`` will only be a :class:`.Molecule`
instance, and not a :class:`.ConstructedMolecule` instance.

If you want to store and retrieve :class:`.ConstructedMolecule`
instances, you have to create a :class:`.ConstructedMoleculeMongoDb`

.. code-block:: python

    constructed_db = stk.ConstructedMoleculeMongoDb(client)
    constructed_db.put(polymer)
    loaded_polymer = constructed_db.get({
        'InChIKey': get_inchi_key('BrCCCCBr'),
    })

Unlike ``loaded``, ``loaded_polymer`` is a
:class:`.ConstructedMolecule` instance.

Placing and Retrieving Molecular Property Values From a Database
================================================================

Requirements
------------

Using a :class:`.ValueMongoDb` has the same requirements as the
previous example.

Storing Values
--------------

Unlike the previous example, you can deposit values for both
a :class:`.BuildingBlock` and a :class:`.ConstructedMolecule` in the
same database. First, lets create one

.. code-block:: python

    import stk
    import pymongo

    # Connect to a MongoDB. This example connects to a local
    # MongoDB, but you can connect to a remote DB too with
    # MongoClient() - read the documentation for pymongo to see how
    # to do that.
    client = pymongo.MongoClient()

    # You have to choose name for your collection.
    energy_db = stk.ValueMongoDb(client, 'energy')

Here, ``energy_db`` will store energy values. Lets create a function
to calculate the energy of a molecule.

.. code-block:: python

    import rdkit.Chem.AllChem as rdkit

    def get_energy(molecule):
        rdkit_molecule = molecule.to_rdkit_mol()
        rdkit.SanitizeMol(rdkit_molecule)
        ff = rdkit.UFFGetMoleculeForceField(rdkit_molecule)
        return ff.CalcEnergy()

Now we can deposit the energy value into the database

.. code-block:: python

    bb = stk.BuildingBlock('BrCCCCBr')
    # Note that as soon as put() is called, the value is placed into
    # permanent storage.
    energy_db.put(bb, get_energy(bb))

Note that :mod:`stk` databases do not have a staging area. The
moment you call :meth:`~.ValueDatabase.put`, the value is
committed to the database.

To retrieve a value from the database, you provide the molecule,
whose value you are interested in

.. code-block:: python

    energy = energy_db.get(bb)


If we make the same molecule in some other way, for example we
can make ``BrCCCCBr`` as a constructed molecule

.. code-block:: python

    polymer = stk.ConstructedMolecule(
        topology_graph=stk.polymer.Linear(
            building_blocks=(
                stk.BuildingBlock('BrCCBr', [stk.BromoFactory()]),
            ),
            repeating_unit='A',
            num_repeating_units=2,
        ),
    )

we can still retrieve the value

.. code-block:: python

    # You get the correct energy out, because polymer and bb are
    # actually the same molecule.
    bb_energy = energy_db.get(polymer)


You can also use a :class:`.ConstructedMolecule` to deposit values
into the database, for example

.. code-block:: python

    atom_count_db = stk.ValueMongoDb(client, 'atom_counts')
    atom_count_db.put(polymer, polymer.get_num_atoms())


These values will also be accessible in a later session

.. code-block:: python

    # Assume this a new Python session.
    import stk
    import pymongo


    client = pymongo.MongoClient()
    energy_db = stk.ValueMongoDb(client, 'energy')
    atom_count_db = stk.ValueMongoDb(client, 'atom_counts')

    bb = stk.BuildingBlock('BrCCCCBr')
    bb_energy = energy_db.get(bb)
    bb_atom_count = atom_count_db.get(bb)

Finally, you can also store, and retrieve, a :class:`tuple` of values
from the database. For example,

.. code-block:: python

    centroid_db = stk.ValueMongoDb(client, 'centroids')
    # Centroid is a position, and therefore a tuple of 3 floats.
    centroid_db.put(bb, tuple(bb.get_centroid()))

    # Retrieve the centroid.
    centroid = centroid_db.get(bb)

Specifying Functional Groups Individually
=========================================

If you want to be more precise about which functional groups get
created, you can provide them directly to the :class:`.BuildingBlock`.
For example, if you have multiple bromo groups on a molecule, but
you only want to use one during construction

.. code-block:: python

    import stk

    bb = stk.BuildingBlock(
        smiles='BrCCCBr',
        functional_groups=[
            stk.Bromo(
                # The number is the atom's id.
                bromine=stk.Br(0),
                atom=stk.C(1),
                # bonders are atoms which have bonds added during
                # construction.
                bonders=(stk.C(1), ),
                # deleters are atoms which are deleted during
                # construction.
                deleters=(stk.Br(0), ),
            ),
        ],
    )

When creating a :class:`.Bromo` functional group, you have to
specify things like which atoms have bonds added during construction,
and which ones are removed during construction. These are specified by
the `bonders` and `deleters` parameters, respectively. You can add
as many functional groups to :class:`.BuildingBlock` as you like
in this way, and you can mix different types of
:mod:`~.functional_groups.functional_group`. You can even mix
a :mod:`~.functional_groups.functional_group` instances with
:mod:`~.functional_group_factory` instances.

Changing Bonder and Deleter Atoms in Functional Group Factories
===============================================================

In the previous example, you saw that during creation of a
:class:`.Bromo` instance, you can specify which atoms have bonds
added during construction, and which atoms are deleted during
construction. You might like to customize this in the functional groups
created by a :mod:`~.functional_group_factory`.

Take, for example, a :class:`.CarboxylicAcid` functional group. There
are two likely ways you would like to modify
this group, ``C(=O)O``, during construction. In the first way, you want
to add a bond to the carbon atom, and delete the ``OH`` group, which is
treated as a leaving group. This is what
:class:`.CarboxylicAcidFactory` will do by default

.. code-block:: python

    import stk

    bb = stk.BuildingBlock(
        smiles='O=C(O)CCC(=O)O',
        functional_groups=[stk.CarboxylicAcidFactory()],
    )

Here, ``bb`` will have two :class:`.CarboxylicAcid` functional groups.
In each, the deleter atoms will be the oxygen and hydrogen atom of
the ``OH`` group, and the bonder atom will be the carbon atom.

Now, the second way you might want to modify a carobxylic acid group,
is to only delete the hydrogen atom of the ``OH`` group during
construction, and add a bond to the oxygen atom of the
``OH`` group. This means the hydrogen atom is the deleter atom and
the oxygen atom is the bonder atom. You can tell the
:class:`.CarboxylicAcidFactory` to create :class:`.CarboxylicAcid`
instances of this kind

.. code-block:: python

    bb2 = stk.BuildingBlock(
        smiles='O=C(O)CCC(=O)O',
        functional_groups=[
            stk.CarboxylicAcidFactory(
                # Atom number 3 corresponds to the OH oxygen atom in a
                # carboxylic acid group. THIS IS NOT THE ATOM'S ID IN
                # THE MOLECULE.
                bonders=(3, ),
                # Atom number 4 corresponds to the hydrogen atom in a
                # carboxylic acid group. THIS IS NOT THE ATOM'S ID IN
                # THE MOLECULE.
                deleters=(4, ),
            ),
        ],
    )

Here, ``bb2`` will also have two :class:`.CarboxylicAcid` functional
groups. In each, the deleter atom will be the hydrogen of the
``OH`` group and the bonder atom will be the oxygen atom of the
``OH`` group.

You might be wondering: "How do I know which number to use for
which atom in the functional group, so that I can specify the correct
atoms to be the bonders or deleters?" The docstring of
:class:`.CarboxylicAcidFactory` will tell you which number corresponds
to which atom in the functional group. The same is true for any
other :mod:`~.functional_group_factory`. Note that the number you
provide to the factory, is not the id of the atom found in the
molecule!!

Handling Molecules with Metal Atoms and Dative Bonds
====================================================

All :mod:`stk` :class:`.Molecule` instances (such as
:class:`.BuildingBlock` and :class:`.ConstructedMolecule`) can contain
metal atoms and handle various coordination reactions.
In order to represent dative bonds in these systems, a bond order of
9 is used.

Furthermore, when working with metal-containing systems, any
:class:`.BuildingBlock` initialization functions that require ETKDG
may fail, because the ETKDG algorithm is liable to fail in these cases.
In cases like this, you probably want to set the position matrix
explicitly, which will mean that ETKDG will not be used.

.. code-block:: python

    import stk

    bb = stk.BuildingBlock('[Fe+2]', position_matrix=[[0., 0., 0.]])

If you want to get a more complex position matrix, defining a
function may be a good idea

.. code-block:: python

    import rdkit.Chem.AllChem as rdkit


    def get_position_matrix(smiles):
        molecule = rdkit.AddHs(rdkit.MolFromSmiles(smiles))
        rdkit.EmbedMolecule(molecule)
        rdkit.UFFOptimizeMolecule(molecule)
        return molecule.GetConformer().GetPositions()


    smiles = 'CCCO->[Fe+2]'
    bb = stk.BuildingBlock(
        smiles=smiles,
        position_matrix=get_position_matrix(smiles),
    )

Finally, :mod:`stk` will also read bonds from ``.mol`` files,
which have a bond order of 9, as dative.

Making Keys for Molecules with Dative Bonds
===========================================

Dative bonds are not defined in an InChI or InChiIKey.
Therefore, when storing metal-containing molecules in a
database, a different key is required. Because dative bonds are
implemented in SMILES, the SMILES string makes a
useful key for metal-containing molecules. You can use the
:class:`.Smiles` key maker for this purpose

.. code-block:: python

    import stk
    import pymongo

    db = stk.MoleculeMongoDb(
        mongo_client=pymongo.MongoClient(),
        jsonizer=stk.MoleculeJsonizer(
            key_makers=(stk.Smiles(), ),
        ),
    )
    bb = stk.BuildingBlock('BrO->[Fe+2]')
    db.put(bb)
    # Use the Smiles() key maker to get the retrieval SMILES,
    # to make sure it has canonical atom ordering.
    canonical_smiles = stk.Smiles().get_key(bb)
    retrieved_bb = db.get({'SMILES': canonical_smiles})

Extending stk
=============

There are a lot of ways to extend :mod:`stk`, for example by adding
new functional groups, topology graphs, mutation operations and so on.
However, because every part of :mod:`stk` is built around an abstract
base class, all you need to do is find the appropriate abstract base
class, and create a new subclass for it. The abstract base class
will provide documentation and examples on how to create a subclass.
You can easily find the abstract base classes by looking at the
sidebar.
