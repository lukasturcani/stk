Overview
========

``stk`` is a Python library which allows construction and
manipulation of complex molecules, as well as automatic
molecular design, and the creation of molecular, and molecular
property, databases.

Installation
============

To get ``stk``, you can install it with pip::

    $ pip install stk

Make sure you also install rdkit, which is a dependency::

    $ conda install -c conda-forge rdkit

If you would like to get updated when a new release of ``stk`` comes
out, which happens pretty regularly, click on the ``watch`` button on
the top right corner of the GitHub page. Then select ``Releases only``
from the dropdown menu.

You can see the latest releases here:

    https://github.com/lukasturcani/stk/releases

There will be a corresponding release on ``pip`` for each release
on GitHub, and you can update your ``stk`` with::

    $ pip install stk --upgrade
