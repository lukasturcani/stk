Overview
========

``stk`` is a Python library which allows construction and
manipulation of complex molecules, as well as automatic
molecular design, and the creation of molecular, and molecular
property, databases. The documentation of ``stk`` is available on
https://stk.readthedocs.io and the project's Discord server can be
joined through https://discord.gg/zbCUzuxe2B.

Installation
============

To get ``stk``, you can install it with pip::

    $ pip install stk

If you would like to get updated when a new release of ``stk`` comes
out, which happens pretty regularly, click on the ``watch`` button on
the top right corner of the GitHub page. Then select ``Releases only``
from the dropdown menu.

You can see the latest releases here:

    https://github.com/lukasturcani/stk/releases

There will be a corresponding release on ``pip`` for each release
on GitHub, and you can update your ``stk`` with::

    $ pip install stk --upgrade
