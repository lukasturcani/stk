"""
Defines mutation operations via the ``Mutation`` class.

Extending MMEA: Adding mutation functions
-----------------------------------------
If a new mutation operation is to be added to MMEA it should be added
as a method in the ``Mutation`` class defined in this module. The only
requirement is that the first argument is ``macro_mol`` (excluding any
``self`` or ``cls`` arguments).

The naming requirement of ``macro_mol`` exists to help users identify
which arguments are handled automatically by MMEA and which they need
to define in the input file. The convention is that if the mutation
function takes an argument called  ``macro_mol`` it does not have to be
specified in the input file.

If the mutation function does not fit neatly into a single function
make sure that any helper functions are private, ie that their names
start with a leading underscore.

    Carries out mutations operations on a population.

    Instances of the ``Population`` class delegate mutation operations
    to instances of this class. They do this by calling:

        >>> mutant_pop = pop.gen_mutants()

    which returns a new population consisting of molecules generated by
    performing mutation operations on members of ``pop``. This class
    invokes an instance of the ``Selection`` class to select molecules
    for mutations. Both an instance of this class and the ``Selection``
    class are held in the `ga_tools` attribute of a ``Population``
    instance.

    This class is initialized with a list of  ``FunctionData``
    instances. Each ``FunctionData`` object holds the name of the
    mutation function to be used by the population as well as any
    additional parameters the function may require. Mutation functions
    should be defined as methods within this class.

    A mutation function from the list will be selected at random, with
    likelihoods modified if the user supplies a `weights` list during
    initialization.

    Members of this class are also initialized with an integer which
    holds the number of mutation operations to be performed each
    generation.

    Attributes
    ----------
    funcs : list of FunctionData instances
        This lists holds all the mutation functions which are to be
        applied by the GA. One will be chosen at random when a mutation
        is desired. The likelihood that each is selected is given by
        `weights`.

    num_mutations : int
        The number of mutations that needs to be performed each
        generation.

    weights : None or list of floats (default = None)
        When ``None`` each mutation function has equal likelihood of
        being picked. If `weights` is a list each float corresponds to
        the probability of selecting the mutation function at the
        corresponding index.

        and mutates them. This goes on until either all possible
        molecules have been mutated or the required number of
        mutation operations have been performed.

        The mutants generated are returned together in a ``Population``
        instance. Any molecules that are created as a result of
        mutation that match a molecule present in the original
